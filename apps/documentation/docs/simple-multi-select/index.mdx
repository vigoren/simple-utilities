# Simple Multi-Select

A library to create simple multiple select elements. These multiple selects look similar to the native select element, but allow users to choose multiple options.

This library uses both JavaScript and CSS. There are several [CSS Variables](css-variables) available to customize the look of the multiple select.

## How It Works

This library works by looking for native multiple select elements on a page and changing them into an easier to use multiple select. The native select element is hidden and a new element is created to replace it.

Attributes set on the native select are used to drive how the new multiple select works.

### Demo

This is a small demo of Simple Multi-Select in action to give an idea on how it works.

<MultiSelectExample id="demoms" />

## Installation

```bash
npm install @simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select
```
## Getting Started

To get started make sure that you include the CSS and JavaScript on your page or into your project files.

### HTML

The HTML for the multiple select is very simple. It is just a native select element with the `multiple` attribute set.

```html
<select multiple>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="3">Option 3</option>
</select>
```

For details about the available attributes and other options check out the [HTML Options](html).

### CSS

You can link to the css file directly or import it into your own css file.

:::note

It is encouraged to import the library into your own css file.

:::


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="file" label="CSS File">

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select/dist/simple-multi-select.css" />
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="import" label="Import">

```css
@import '@simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select/dist/simple-multi-select.css';
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For more options on customizing the CSS check out the available [CSS Variables](css-variables).

#### Dark Mode

This library supports dark mode by setting the `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element. The default theme is `light`. To use the dark theme set the `data-theme` attribute to `dark`.

```html
<html data-theme="dark">
```


### JavaScript

Once you have the HTML for your multi-select element, the JavaScript need to be added to the page. This library is available as an ES Module and a UMD module.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="es" label="ES Module">

```javascript
import {MultiSelect, InitializeAllMultiSelects} from "@simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select";
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="umd" label="UMD">

```javascript
const { MultiSelect, InitializeAllMultiSelects } = require("@simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select");
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Details about how to initialize the multi-selects and the available options can be found in the [JavaScript Options](javascript/index.mdx).
