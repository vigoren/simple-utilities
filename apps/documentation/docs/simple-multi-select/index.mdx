# Simple Multi-Select

A library to create simple multiple select elements. These multiple selects look similar to the native select element, but allow users to choose multiple options.

This library uses both JavaScript and CSS. There are several [CSS Variables](css-variables) available to customize the look of the multiple select.

## How It Works

This library works by looking for native multiple select elements on a page and changing them into an easier to use multiple select. The native select element is hidden and a new element is created to replace it.

Attributes set on the native select are used to drive how the new multiple select works.

### Demo

This is a small demo of Simple Multi-Select in action to give an idea on how it works.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select
```
## Getting Started

### HTML

The HTML for the multiple select is very simple. It is just a native select element with the `multiple` attribute set.

```html
<select multiple>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="3">Option 3</option>
</select>
```

There are several optional attributes that can be set on the native select element to customize the multiple select.

#### `data-none-selected-text`

This attribute sets the text that is displayed when no options are selected. If this attribute is not set, the default text is `None Selected`.

```html
<select multiple data-none-selected-text="Select Options">
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="3">Option 3</option>
</select>
```

#### `data-label`

If no label is associated with the native select element, this attribute can be used to set the label for the multiple select. This is the text shown above the selected options.

```html
<select multiple data-label="My Great Multiple Select">
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="3">Option 3</option>
</select>
```

## JavaScript

Once you have the HTML for your multi-select element, the JavaScript need to be added to the page. This library is available as an ES Module and a UMD module.

### ES Module

```javascript
import {MultiSelect, InitializeAllMultiSelects, multiSelects} from "@simple-web-utilities/simple-multi-select";
```

### UMD

```javascript
const {MultiSelect, InitializeAllMultiSelects, multiSelects} = SimpleMultiSelect;
```

### Initialize

By default, the library will automatically initialize all multiple select elements on the page. If you want to initialize them manually, you can use the `InitializeAllMultiSelects` function or with the `MultiSelect` class.

#### Initialize All

This function looks for every multiple select element on the page and initializes them. If the multiple select has already been initialized, it will be skipped.

```javascript
InitializeAllMultiSelects();
```

#### Initialize with Class

This class can be used to initialize a single multiple select element. The constructor takes the native select element as a parameter.

It can optionally also accept a label element. If the label element is not passed in, it will create one.

```javascript
const multiSelect1 = new MultiSelect(document.getElementById("demo"));

const multiSelect2 = new MultiSelect(document.getElementById("demo"), document.getElementById("label"));
```

#### Initialized Multiple Selects

When the `InitializeAllMultiSelects` function is run automatically it generates an array of all the initialized multiple select elements. This array is available as the `multiSelects` variable.

```javascript
multiSelects.forEach((multiSelect) => {
  // Do something with the multiple select
});
```

### Using the Class

After the multiple select has been initialized, there are several methods available to interact with it.
