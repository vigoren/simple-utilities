# Simple Animation

A simple animation library for CSS and JS/TS projects. 

This library is intended to have a small number of commonly used animations that can be easily incorporated into other projects. As such keeping the overall size of the library small is a priority.

Most of the animations are CSS only. The JavaScript/TypeScript animations are added to allow for more complex animations that are not possible with CSS alone.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @simple-utilities/simple-animation
```
