# CSS Animations

## Getting Started

To use the CSS animations, import the CSS file into your project.

```css
@import '~@simple-web-utilities/simple-animation/dist/simple-animation.css';
```

Then apply the animation class to the element you want to animate.

```html
<div class="simple-animation sa-fade-in">...</div>
```

It is as easy as that! For more details check out the individual animation pages.
